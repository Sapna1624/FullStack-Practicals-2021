    <p style="background-color: grey;">JavaScript is a client-side scripting language of web developed.JavaScript is used to build interactive websites with dynamic features and to validate form data. JavaScript is high-level, dynamic and browser interpreted programming language, supported by all modern web browsers. Apart from web browser, JavaScript is also used to build scalable web applications using Node JS. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile application development. JavaScript is also known as the Programming Language of web as it is the only programming language for Web browsers. JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform. The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads. Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run. The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.</p>
